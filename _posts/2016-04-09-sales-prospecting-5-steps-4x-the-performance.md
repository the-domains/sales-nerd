# Sales Prospecting: 5 Steps 4x the Performance

When it
comes to sales prospecting the research is in, those who provide a structured
process see a 16% increase in performance and 30% greater profits ([Sales Management Association][0]).Below, I
share the 5 step process used to quadruple the performance of my own sales
funnel.

## Step 1: Customer profiling  
Customer
profiling helps you invest your sales resources in the people who are most
likely to convert. [Hubspot][1] has done a nice job explaining how to
develop an ideal customer profile (ICP); in short, look for common
characteristics among your top customers.

You can
start the process by looking at basic characteristics such as industry, job
title, and geography.To segment or
build deeper profiles look for commonality among social media groups,
technology, and skill set.

Here is an example: CIO currently working in higher education, previously
worked as a software developer, degree in computer science, passionate about
open source, active member on several big data LinkedIn Groups.

Knowing that
a person who resembles this profile is more likely to convert allows you to
focus your efforts on the right people.

## Step 2: Trigger Events  
Using
trigger events prioritizes people who have the most immediate need for your
product or service.

With a bit
of research you can figure out the online sites and social media platforms which
host and give relevant information about your target audience.For example, if you were targeting technology
startups, you could use sites like LinkedIn, Google News, Tech Crunch, and
Angel List.

All of these
sites give updates which indicate if a company or person has a timely need for a
variety of products or services.Some of
the indicators might be a job posting requiring expertise you provide or company
news about an expansion or product launch.To apply this approach to your business, determine where your target
audience is online and start monitoring those channels for updates.

Here are a
few setup guides

## Step 3: Prequalification  
An easy way
to lower your customer acquisition costs is to prevent low quality prospects from
entering your sales funnel in the first place.

To
prequalify, create a set of requirements you can validate, **without having to contact the prospect**.Trying to schedule a call with a stranger can
be a time intensive task, so the more unqualified people you can weed out the
better.To do this, create a checklist
of things which indicate qualified or unqualified that can also be researched
online.Here are a few examples:\*

Does this company have at least xyz people in
the xyz department?  
Has this company received funding?  
Is this person the most senior decision maker
connected to  
Does this company use xyz technology?  
Does this person's LinkedIn profile indicate
proficiency in xyz?

## Step 4 & 5: CRM & Enrichment  
To make sure
your work doesn't go to waste, record the harvested information inside a CRM
and enrich it with other pertinent details.**A good CRM has too many benefits
to list**, but the most common are: analytics, duplicate prevention, and
automation.Personally, I use [Hubspot
CRM][2] because of the design, ease of use, and amazing customer support.Whichever CRM you choose, consider removing all buttons, input fields, and
nifty do-dads, unless they are necessary to complete some aspect of your sales
funnel.This is helpful because people
use CRM's and the more options we have, the slower we go, and the more mistakes
we make.You can always add objects into
your CRM at a later date, but if you limit yourself to only capturing highly
relevant data you keep bureaucracy at bay.

Worthwhile
CRM objects (something to build on)  
Contact
Details  
Relevant
Social Media Accounts  
Source
(where did you find this prospect)  
Status (uncontacted, conversation started,
demo-ready, etc.)  
Lifecycle
stage (subscriber, lead, sales ready, etc.)

## Lead Generation  

If you go
through all 5 steps you will have a CRM full of prequalified prospects enriched
with data, which is exactly what you need for a successful lead generation campaign.To learn more about the different strategies
to convert prospects into leads, check out some of my other posts at
